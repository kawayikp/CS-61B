I did the project myself, since this is the first 2 weeks I learning Java, I can't guaratee the correctence of the code.

I use terminal to compile and run the project, the result is correct, but I still have some problem.
1. how to run the project in eclipse?
   I import the .jar file and .tiff file in eclipse, use Run->Run configuration to input parameters of the main method, and there are original picture ,blured picture and edged picture displayed in my Mac, but eclipse has error "can't find file", and the blured picture can't be stored in my file system as stored by terminal.
2. I didn't use Test.java and Data which are given by the professor, could anyone tell me what they are.

Please feel free to communicate, thanks for replying.
