Part 2 of the assignment asks you to find which parts of the DList have weakness against hostile or badly written code. The main culprit is: a DListNode node, when passed as a parameter to some of the methods, may not even be part of this Dlist instance.

It would be tring to create a DListNode not even in the DList and call
insertAfter(), insertBefore(), prev(), next(), remove();
This will corrupt the size field;
Also the whole list

belongs to
